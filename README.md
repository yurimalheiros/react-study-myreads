# MyReads Project

MyReads is a web application to manage a user book library.

Using the application, users can organize their books on three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. Also, users can search to add more books to their library.

## How it works

The web application uses React to implement its interface and uses an API to retrieve, update, and persist data. On the main page, the application gets the books' information and presents it on the three shelves. For each book, a user can change its shelf, and the application updates the book location. Last, on the search page, the application uses the API to query the books according to the user input, and for each book, the user can update its shelf.

## How to run

Follow the steps to run the project:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
